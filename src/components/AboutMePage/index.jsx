            <p>
                Hello! I am a software engineer with an educational background in computer science and a hands-on full-stack bootcamp. <br /><br />

                My past includes going to college for 3 years for a computer science degree. I decided to learn a specific set of skills rather than the basics of many topics, so I decided to seek a coding bootcamp. I have also worked in movie theaters for 3 years and was a highly valued team member. I received team member of the month for the opening month of a movie theater. <br /><br />

                I am sharp and can pick things up surprisingly quickly. I am dedicated and hard-working.<br /><br />

                My hobbies include playing video games, watching movies/shows/videos, and bouldering.
